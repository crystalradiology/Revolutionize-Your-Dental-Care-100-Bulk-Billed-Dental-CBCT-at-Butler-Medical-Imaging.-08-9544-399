What is a Dental Cone beam CT (CBCT)?
Cone-beam computed tomography systems (CBCT) are a variation of traditional computed tomography (CT) systems. The CBCT systems used by dental professionals, capturing data using a cone-shaped X-ray beam.
These data are used to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3D) image of the following regions of the patient’s anatomy: dental (teeth); oral and maxillofacial region (mouth, jaw, and neck); and ears, nose, and throat.
Why is Dental CBCT Important?
1. Accurate Diagnosis
The detailed 3D images produced by CBCT scans allow dentists to see structures that might not be visible with regular X-rays. This includes the precise location of teeth, their roots, and the surrounding bone, which is crucial for diagnosing issues such as impacted teeth, cysts, tumors, and bone abnormalities.
2. Enhanced Treatment Planning
For procedures such as dental implants, CBCT provides critical information about the thickness and density of the bone, helping dentists plan the exact placement of the implant. It also assists in planning for orthodontic treatments and evaluating the condition of the jawbone before surgery.
3. Improved Patient Outcomes
By providing a clear and detailed view of the dental structures, CBCT scans help dentists perform more precise treatments, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced risk of complications.
How Does Dental CBCT Work?
A CBCT scanner rotates around the patient's head, capturing multiple images from various angles. These images are then reconstructed by a computer to create a detailed 3D model of the scanned area. This process provides a high-resolution, clear view of the dental structures, revealing details that are not visible in standard 2D X-rays.

What happens during my dental x-ray and CBCT?
You will be asked to stand, biting on a mouth piece. The radiographer will position you in the correct position. The machine will then rotate around your head acquiring the images of your teeth.
How long will it take?
A dental CBCT can take approximately up to 10 minutes.
